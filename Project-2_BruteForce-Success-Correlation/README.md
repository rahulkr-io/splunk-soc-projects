# üõ°Ô∏è Project 2: Brute Force Attack Detection with Success Correlation (Splunk ES | MITRE T1110)

> Detects a potential account compromise by identifying multiple failed login attempts (brute force) followed by a successful login.

---

## üéØ Objective

To detect a brute-force attack scenario where an attacker attempts multiple failed logins (EventCode=4625) followed by a successful login (EventCode=4624), which may indicate credential compromise.

Implemented end-to-end detection using **Splunk Enterprise Security (ES)** with both **raw event-based SPL queries** and **CIM-compliant Authentication data model**, followed by **correlation rule creation** and **notable event alerting**.

## üîç Raw Log Based SPL Queries

### üîπ Failed Login Detection
```spl
index=main sourcetype="WMI:WinEventLog:Security" OR sourcetype="XmlWinEventLog:Security" EventCode=4625
| stats count as failed_count by Account_Name, src, dest
| where failed_count >= 5
````

### üîπ Successful Login Detection

```spl
index=main sourcetype="WMI:WinEventLog:Security" OR sourcetype="XmlWinEventLog:Security" EventCode=4624
| stats earliest(_time) as success_time by Account_Name, src, dest
```

### üîπ Combined Correlation (Raw Log Based)

```spl
index=main sourcetype="WMI:WinEventLog:Security" OR sourcetype="XmlWinEventLog:Security" EventCode=4625
| stats count as failed_count by Account_Name, src, dest
| where failed_count >= 5
| append [
    search index=main sourcetype="WMI:WinEventLog:Security" OR sourcetype="XmlWinEventLog:Security" EventCode=4624
    | stats earliest(_time) as success_time by Account_Name, src, dest
]
| stats values(failed_count) as failed_count, values(success_time) as success_time by Account_Name, src, dest
| where isnotnull(failed_count)
```

---

## üåê Data Model Based SPL Query

### üîπ Combined Correlation (Authentication Data Model)

```spl
| tstats `summariesonly` count as failed_count 
  from datamodel=Authentication 
  where Authentication.action="failure"
  by Authentication.user, Authentication.src, Authentication.dest
| where failed_count >= 5
| append [
    | tstats `summariesonly` earliest(_time) as success_time 
      from datamodel=Authentication 
      where Authentication.action="success"
      by Authentication.user, Authentication.src, Authentication.dest
]
| stats values(failed_count) as failed_count, values(success_time) as success_time by Authentication.user, Authentication.src, Authentication.dest
| where isnotnull(failed_count)
```

## üö® Notable Event Configuration

* **Title**:
  `Brute Force Alert: $Authentication.user$ had $failed_count$ failures from $Authentication.src$`

* **Description**:
  `User $Authentication.user$ had multiple failed login attempts (>=5) from source $Authentication.src$. A successful login may have followed at $success_time$. Investigate possible credential compromise.`

* **Drill-down Search**:

```spl
index=main (EventCode=4625 OR EventCode=4624) user=$Authentication.user$ src=$Authentication.src$
```

## üß™ Detection Analysis

During implementation and testing, the following observations were made:

* A total of **64 correlation results** were observed using the data model‚Äìbased SPL. All involved multiple failed login attempts (`failed\_count >= 5`), but **no corresponding successful login events** were identified.
* The internal host `xxx.xx.xx.50` was most frequently targeted by various external IPs, repeatedly attempting logins using admin-like usernames (`admin`, `root`, `fortinet`, `ubuntu`).
* Source IPs such as 125.133.17.163 and 112.169.8.251 attempted hundreds of login failures, signaling persistent, possibly scripted, attack behavior.
* Raw log search showed failed login attempts from users like `RAHUL`, `aravind`, and `kishore`, which were not reflected in the data model‚Äîsuggesting normalization.
* Absence of any successful login despite high failure volume indicates password policies or external-facing access controls were effective at this stage.
* The correlation rule triggered a **real-time notable event**, proving the effectiveness of the detection logic.
