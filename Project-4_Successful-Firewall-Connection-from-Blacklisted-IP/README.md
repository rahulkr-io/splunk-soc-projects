# üõ°Ô∏è Successful Firewall Connection from Blacklisted IP (Threat Intel-based Detection)

> Detects and alerts on successful firewall connections **allowed from known blacklisted IP addresses**, indicating a critical potential security risk. Includes real-world threat enrichment using AbuseIPDB, Cisco Talos, and VirusTotal.

---

## üéØ Overview

In this project, we designed and implemented a **threat intelligence-based correlation search** in **Splunk Enterprise Security (ES)** to detect allowed firewall traffic originating from **malicious IPs present in a custom blacklist**. These IPs were validated using external **Threat Intelligence (TI) platforms**, and we discovered successful **SSH , HTTPS and custom TCP port (4433)** connections from high-confidence malicious sources.

The goal was to simulate a **real-world SOC use case** involving:

- TI-based detection logic  
- Firewall log analysis  
- Correlation rule configuration  
- Manual IP enrichment  
- Alert triage and recommendations

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Detect incoming allowed connections from blacklisted external IPs  
- Validate the threat using open-source TI platforms  
- Generate a real-time notable alert via Splunk ES  
- Practice a complete SOC L1 detection + triage workflow

## üß† Detection Workflow

### 1. üîß Lookup Table Creation

A custom lookup file `blacklist_ips.csv` was created with known malicious IPs.

- üì∏ [Create Lookup Table](./screenshots/lookup_creation/lookup_create.png)  
- üì∏ [Verify Lookup via SPL](./screenshots/lookup_creation/lookup_verify_search.png)  
- üì∏ [Set Permissions Global](./screenshots/lookup_creation/lookup_permission.png)  

```csv
src_ip
195.178.110.160
3.130.96.91
3.131.215.38

### 2. üîç SPL Query for Detection

```spl
index=main sourcetype=fortigate_traffic action=allowed
| where NOT (cidrmatch("10.0.0.0/8", src) OR cidrmatch("172.16.0.0/12", src) OR cidrmatch("192.168.0.0/16", src))
| lookup blacklist_ips.csv src_ip OUTPUT src_ip as blacklisted_ip
| search blacklisted_ip=*
| stats count earliest(_time) as first_seen latest(_time) as last_seen by src, dest, dest_port, service, action, blacklisted_ip
| eval first_seen=strftime(first_seen, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
| eval last_seen=strftime(last_seen, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

## üåê Threat Intelligence Enrichment

To validate the malicious nature of the blacklisted IPs that were successfully allowed through the firewall, we manually enriched each IP using:

* [AbuseIPDB](https://abuseipdb.com)
* [Cisco Talos Intelligence](https://talosintelligence.com)
* [VirusTotal](https://virustotal.com)

| Blacklisted IP      | AbuseIPDB Reports                                  | Talos Reputation                           | VirusTotal (Vendors Flagged)       | Verdict              |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **195.178.110.160** | 34,039 reports, 100% confidence, Netherlands       | Untrusted, SBL listed                      | 9/94 (ArcSight, CyRadar, etc.)     | **Highly Malicious** |
| **3.130.96.91**     | 3,119 reports, 100% confidence, scan.cypex.ai      | Untrusted, on Talos blocklist              | 10/94 (Fortinet, MalwareURL, etc.) | **Malicious**        |
| **3.131.215.38**    | 2,312 reports, 100% confidence, AWS infrastructure | Poor reputation, suspicious classification | 8/94 (Fortinet, PhishTank, etc.)   | **Suspicious**       |

## üõ°Ô∏è SOC Analyst Actions & Recommendations

Following the detection of successful inbound connections from known blacklisted IPs, the following actions are recommended to ensure proper triage, containment, and prevention:

---

### üîç 1. Investigate Affected Destination Host(s)

Perform endpoint triage on the internal system(s) that received traffic:

* Check for **SSH login activity**, user sessions, and authentication patterns.
* Look for signs of **service exploitation**, unexpected processes, or suspicious behavior.
* Verify system logs, startup entries, and scheduled tasks for persistence indicators.

---

### üîí 2. Contain and Block Malicious IPs

* Add the confirmed blacklisted IPs to the **firewall blocklist** to prevent further access.
* Where supported, **integrate dynamic threat feeds** for real-time TI-based blocking.
* Ensure the block is enforced across all relevant perimeter and cloud firewalls.

---

### üïµÔ∏è 3. Perform Historical Threat Hunting

Analyze past logs (last 7‚Äì30 days) to uncover broader activity:

* Identify **repeated access attempts** from the same malicious IPs.
* Look for connections to **other internal hosts or ports**.
* Detect signs of **lateral movement** or privilege escalation within the network.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 4. Review External Exposure & Hardening Measures

* Enforce **SSH key-based authentication** (if password login is enabled).
* Investigate services running on **non-standard ports** (e.g., TCP/4433).
* Audit and update **firewall rules** to ensure only essential services are exposed externally.

‚úÖ Practiced raw log filtering, correlation, and event investigation.        
‚úÖ Manually enriched threat data using AbuseIPDB, Cisco Talos, and VirusTotal to validate IP reputation.   
‚úÖ Analyzed real-world traffic to identify multiple allowed SSH and TCP connections from confirmed malicious IPs.
